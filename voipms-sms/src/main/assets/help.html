<h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>

<h2 id="account">Account</h2>

<h3>Email address and API password</h3>

<p>This application requires access to the VoIP.ms API in order to retrieve SMS messages from your VoIP.ms account.</p>

<p>As such, before using this application, please ensure that you have:</p>

<ul>
    <li>enabled API access for your VoIP.ms account;</li>
    <li>set an API password (which is <strong>distinct</strong> from your account password); and</li>
    <li>set a list of approved IP addresses (or "0.0.0.0" to allow access from any IP address).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make changes to VoIP.ms API settings <a href="https://www.voip.ms/m/api.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>When signing into this application in Settings, please use:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the email address you use to sign into the VoIP.ms portal (<strong>not</strong> your SIP username); and</li>
    <li>the API password which you set above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DID (phone number)</h3>

<p>This application can only retrieve SMS messages from one DID (phone number) in your account at a time.</p>

<p>As such, before using this application, you must select a DID from a list of SMS-enabled DIDs in your VoIP.ms
    account in Settings.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>

<p>You can initiate a synchronization with the VoIP.ms servers by swiping down on the conversations list.</p>

<p>Synchronization tends to use up a lot of data if you don't have the "Retrieve only recent messages" option enabled,
    so you should minimize how often you do it. In general, it is only necessary to synchronize:</p>
<ul>
    <li>when you first install the application, in order to download all messages from VoIP.ms, and</li>
    <li>when you want to keep the local copy of SMS messages and the server copy in sync.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, it is not necessary to perform a synchronization to retrieve new messages; all new messages are
    downloaded automatically when the main conversations screen is loaded and when a push notification is received.</p>

<p>This limited update only looks at messages dated after the most recent message stored locally (similar to the
    "Retrieve only recent messages" option), so it uses up a lot less data.</p>

<h3>Synchronization interval</h3>

<p>You can configure the application to perform synchronizations automatically. Since it's not necessary to
    synchronize that often, the smallest interval is one day.</p>

<h3>Message retrieval start date</h3>

<p>When the application synchronizes with the VoIP.ms servers, it only retrieves messages on or after the message
    retrieval start date.</p>

<p>By default, this date is set to the date you installed the application. It is recommended that you set this to
    the date on which you created your VoIP.ms account, so that all of your SMS messages will be downloaded during synchronization.</p>

<h3>Retrieve only recent messages</h3>

<p>Normally, synchronization retrieves all messages dated on or after the message retrieval start date. You can
    configure synchronization to retrieve only those messages from the VoIP.ms servers that are dated after the most
    recent message that is stored locally by enabling this option.</p>

<p>This option significantly reduces the amount of data that synchronization uses.</p>

<h3>Retrieve deleted messages</h3>

<p>Normally, synchronization does not retrieve messages that have been deleted locally. You can choose to restore
    these messages during synchronization by enabling this option.</p>

<h3>Propagate local deletions</h3>

<p>Normally, synchronization< does not delete messages stored on the VoIP.ms servers that were deleted locally. You
    can choose to do this by enabling this option.</p>

<h3>Propagate remote deletions</h3>

<p>Normally, synchronization does not delete messages stored locally if they have been deleted from the VoIP.ms
    servers. You can choose to do this by enabling this option.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once you delete a message from the VoIP.ms servers, you can't put it back! This is true
    even if the message is stored locally. The VoIP.ms SMS API does not allow you to upload messages to the VoIP.ms
    servers.</p>

<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>

<p>This application supports push notifications using Google Cloud Messaging. To enable push notifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>make sure your device is connected to the Internet, then enable notifications in Settings; and</li>
    <li>access the SMS settings for your DID on the VoIP.ms portal and enable the 'SMS URL Callback' feature,
        entering the following URL into the neighbouring field: <a href="http://voipmssms-kourlas.rhcloud.com/sms_callback?did={TO}">http://voipmssms-kourlas.rhcloud.com/sms_callback?did={TO}</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can make changes to VoIP.ms DID settings <a href="https://voip.ms/m/managedid.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>The application will attempt to configure the URL callback feature for you automatically when you enable
    notifications; this second step is only necessary if the automatic configuration fails.</p>

<p>When push notifications are enabled, the application stores your DID and GCM registration ID on a server run by the
    developer. When your DID receives a text message, VoIP.ms will send a callback to the server. The server will then
    forward the callback to your device using Google Cloud Messaging.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy, the server <strong>only</strong> links DIDs with GCM registration IDs and tells your
    device when to sync with the VoIP.ms servers. It does not process or store the text of individual SMSes.</p>

<h2 id="database">Database</h2>

<h3>Edit message database</h3>

<p>This option exports the message database in JSON format and allows you to make changes to it using a text editor.</p>

<p>This allows you to make backups of the database in case you delete messages from the VoIP.ms servers or simply want
    to avoid re-downloading them all from the servers after resetting your phone.</p>

<h3>Delete message database</h3>

<p>This option deletes the entire SMS message database. This option is useful if you want to clean out old messages
    associated with a DID you no longer use.</p>

<h1 id="donations">Donations</h1>

<p>If you'd like, you can make a donation to the developer using Google's in-app purchase feature in $0.99 CAD
    increments (or the equivalent in your local currency) using the Donate option in the application's main menu.</p>

<p>The in-app purchase is consumed immediately after you make the donation, so you can donate as many times as you'd
    like! :)</p>

<p>If you'd rather donate via PayPal, please click <a href="https://paypal.me/kourlas">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Making a donation does not unlock any additional features.</p>
