# VoIP.ms SMS #

## Overview ##

VoIP.ms SMS is an Apache Cordova based mobile application that sends and receives SMS messages using a VoIP.ms account.

## Features ##

Many people (including myself, as of the time of writing) use VoIP.ms as an alternative to a voice plan on our mobile
devices. Unfortunately, this can make texting rather difficult, as the VoIP.ms SMS Message Center is built for desktop
browsers and is difficult to navigate and use on a mobile device. While VoIP.ms does provide a [mobile version]
(https://sms.voip.ms/) of this interface, they do not provide an dedicated mobile application, precluding important
features like notifications and device contacts synchronization.

Cue VoIP.ms SMS, an application that allows you to send and receive SMS messages using your VoIP.ms account. The
application's features include:

* The ability to send and receive texts (obviously)
* Conversation-based organization (all texts to and from a particular phone number are grouped together)
* Synchronization with device contacts (including name and photo)
* Notifications when new texts are received
* Ability to retrieve entire SMS history stored on VoIP.ms servers (~90 days at the moment)
* Support for multiple local phone numbers (DIDs)

## Installation ##

The application is available from the Google Play Store and from the Releases section of the GitHub repository.

## Known Issues ##

* Messages cannot yet be deleted from the VoIP.ms servers.
* The application must be open in order to receive notifications.
