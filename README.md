# VoIP.ms SMS #

## Overview ##

VoIP.ms SMS is an Android application that sends and receives SMS messages using a VoIP.ms account.

## Features ##

Many people use VoIP.ms as an alternative to a voice plan on our mobile devices. Unfortunately, this can make texting 
rather difficult, as the VoIP.ms SMS Message Center is built for desktop browsers and is difficult to navigate and use 
on a mobile device. While VoIP.ms does provide a [mobile version](https://sms.voip.ms/) of this interface, they do not 
provide a dedicated mobile application, precluding important features like notifications and contacts synchronization.

Cue VoIP.ms SMS, an application that allows you to send and receive SMS messages using your VoIP.ms account. The
application's features include:

* The ability to send, receive, and delete texts;
* Conversation-based organization (all texts to and from a particular phone number are grouped together);
* Synchronization with device contacts, including the contact's name and photo; and
* Notifications when new texts are received.

## Installation ##

The application is available from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kourlas.voipms_sms) 
and from the [Releases section](https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms/releases) of the GitHub repository.
